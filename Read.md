## 🧪 Testing

### 🎮 Interactive Web Testing

1. **Open the web interface** at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
2. **Use Quick Test buttons:**
   - 🚨 **Phishing Sample**: High-risk email with multiple threats
   - ✅ **Legitimate Sample**: Safe email from trusted source
   - ⚠️ **Suspicious Sample**: Medium-risk email with some indicators

3. **View detailed analysis:**
   - Overall risk score and level
   - Breakdown by analysis category
   - Specific threat indicators found
   - Quarantine recommendations

### 🔬 API Testing

Test the detection engine programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sender": "security@paypaI.com",
    "subject": "URGENT: Account Suspended - Act Now!",
    "content": "Your account will be closed! Click: http://bit.ly/fake-paypal",
    "attachments": ["verification.exe"]
  }'
```

### 🐍 Python Integration

```python
from phishing_detector import PhishingDetector

detector = PhishingDetector()
result = detector.analyze_email(
    email_content="Suspicious email content...",
    sender="suspicious@domain.com",
    subject="Urgent Action Required!"
)

print(f"Risk Level: {result.risk_level}")
print(f"Score: {result.total_score}")
print(f"Quarantine: {detector.should_quarantine(result)}")
```

## 📊 How It Works

### 🧠 **AI Detection Engine**

The system employs a multi-layered approach to email analysis:

1. **Preprocessing**: Email parsing and content extraction
2. **Feature Engineering**: URL extraction, sender analysis, content tokenization
3. **Threat Detection**: Pattern matching, ML classification, rule-based analysis
4. **Risk Scoring**: Weighted scoring system with threat level classification
5. **Decision Making**: Automated quarantine recommendations

### 🎯 **Scoring System**

| Risk Level | Score Range | Action | Description |
|------------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 🟢 **SAFE** | 0-2 points | ✅ Deliver | No threats detected |
| 🟡 **LOW** | 3-5 points | 👀 Monitor | Minor indicators present |
| 🟠 **MEDIUM** | 6-9 points | ⚠️ Flag for Review | Likely phishing attempt |
| 🔴 **HIGH** | 10+ points | 🚫 Quarantine | Definite threat detected |

### 🔍 **Detection Categories**

- **Sender Analysis** (0-6 points): Domain spoofing, reputation, patterns
- **URL Analysis** (0-8 points): Malicious links, shorteners, suspicious domains
- **Content Analysis** (0-6 points): Keywords, sentiment, linguistic patterns
- **Attachment Analysis** (0-8 points): File types, extensions, suspicious names

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Custom Detection Rules

Enhance the detector with your own rules by editing `phishing_detector.py`:

```python
# Add custom suspicious domains
self.suspicious_domains.extend([
    'your-suspicious-domain.com',
    'another-bad-domain.net'
])

# Add custom phishing keywords
self.phishing_keywords.extend([
    'your custom keyword',
    'another suspicious phrase'
])

# Adjust scoring weights
if 'your_condition':
    score += 5  # Custom scoring logic
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file for production settings:

```env
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
PORT=8080
```
